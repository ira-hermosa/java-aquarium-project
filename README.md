Aquarium project is an application created to consolidate JDBC learnings.

The application is connected to a database in MySQL and allows user to:
- add a fish to database
- read all fish in the database
- read fish by id
- update a fish in the database
- delete a fish by its id
- delete all fish
- add fish to an orderBasket array
- count cost of all fish in the orderBasket array

All methods in the Aquarium Manager are run through the main class by instantiate the AquariumManager class and append the methods to the object.

All methods are tested using JUnit 5.
